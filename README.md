# codelines
Javascript that generates random lines on an html page that looks like code.

Modeled after the the mini-map extension for the Atom text editor: https://atom.io/packages/minimap

See it in action @ http://codelines.xyz

index.html and thing.js are the old and less complex versions of the implementation.


# Next Steps:

- convert colored boxes into syntactically correct javascript code (Javascr-ipsum) (textindex.html and textthing.js)
- make it only generate semantically correct javascript. (random functionalities (wut))
